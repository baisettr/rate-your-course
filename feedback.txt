The modal looks good and works well, and checks for required fields. However, it is somewhat long. It might be better to have a dedicated page for it.

When I go to a course page, I have no idea that there is a course reviews section to scroll down to.

When there are no course reviews, there is just a header that says Course Reviews and no indication that there should be anything underneath, kind of looks like it might be broken.

When searching for a course, it might be nice to be able to search by department, but I don't feel strongly about that. Maybe should sort based on whether my search query appears at the beginning of the entry.

Overall, the site is very fast and it's clear what to do.

I guess you know the overall rating doesn't appear yet.

On the course pages, having a desription and other information will improve the look.

In addition to the Term, would like to have the year.

Desired fields for Leave a Review: Professor (name)

Instead of "Useful links and subject stuff", maybe Helpful Resources

Instead of "Pre tips", maybe Advice for Preparing for the Course

Field suggestion: What you should know before taking the course

Indicate somewhere that the post will be completely anonymous

Instead of "Overall feedback", Overall Rating

Instead of "Drawbacks", "Things you didn't like about the course"

On fields labels, be consistent about capitalization

On Course Reviews section, could have hover-over tooltips for fields to see what they are for

On Leave a Review modal, could have same labels as on Course Reviews area, but have the tooltip text visible without hovering over

Most recent course review should appear at top

On course page, on description area, may want to change colors or opacity of description background area so that text can be read easily
